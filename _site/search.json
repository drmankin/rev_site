In other words, is the third model (with three predictors) a significant improvement over the second model (with two predictors)?\nWhich predictor(s) in the better model are significant and which ones aren’t?\nWhich predictor in the better model has the biggest impact on the outcome?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMake sure to take note of your answers!
